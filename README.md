# Virtual-Router-APP
Simulation of routers lookup implementing Binary lookup, MultiBit Lookup, Compressed and Patricia Lookup Algorithms

This is a desktop application that uses a list of random ip adresses and find the exit interface depending on the destination adress,
same process used by physical routers for fast IP adress Lookup using different algortihms base on search tries and structured data.

Implemented the Binary Serach Trie, Compressed, Multibit and Patiricia algortihms as well.
